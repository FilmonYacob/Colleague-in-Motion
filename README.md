# Colleague in Motion
Colleague in Motion is a free website that helps colleagues to compete in sports activities. The sport activities are converted to number of steps. The number of steps are then used to rank the colleagues. 

Coming soon: The site will use a machine learning model (Gaussian processes) to predict the number of steps per week for each colleague. This encourages a colleague to compete against the model prediction as well. Everytime the a colleague wins makes it harder to win in the next attempt.
